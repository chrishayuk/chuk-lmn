# 1) Some typed array of int => int[]
let smallInts:int[] = [1, 2, 3, 42]
print "int[] =>" smallInts

# 2) Big integers => long[]
let bigVals:long[] = [2147483648, 4294967298, 999999999999]
print "long[] =>" bigVals

# 3) Floats => float[]
let floatVals:float[] = [1.0, 2.5, 3.14]
print "float[] =>" floatVals

# 4) Doubles => double[]
let doubleVals:double[] = [100.0, 2.71828, 1.23456789e2]
print "double[] =>" doubleVals

# 5) Some simple usage
# We'll show that you can also have typed arrays with negative and large mixed values
let moreInts:int[] = [-1, -2, 9999, 42, 100000]
print "more ints =>" moreInts

# 6) Possibly a JSON object to confirm you can still handle that
let user = {
  "name": "Alice",
  "ids": [101, 202, 303]
}
print "User data =>" user

# 7) Show printing typed arrays next to a string literal
print "End of typed arrays test!"
